          <h1>What is a Terms of Service Agreement?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>A Terms of Service agreement (ToS) is an agreement between a service provider and its users/customers.</li>
            <li>The agreement outlines the terms on which you are allowed to use the service being provided.</li>
            <li>They typically offer the service provider legal protection, as you agree to not hold them liable.</li>
            <li>Without agreeing to the terms, you will not be allowed to use the service. The provider makes clear that using the service is an implicit agreement to the terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1>How do Companies Abuse Them?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>ToS agreements are often very long and hard to read, which leads to users not reading the entirety.</li>
            <li>Companies take advantage of this by making users agree to predatory terms before allowing access to their services.</li>
            <li>The word choice, sometimes called "legalese" due to its complicated nature, makes the simplest of ideas hard to understand.</li>
