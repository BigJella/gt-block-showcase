# Privacy Police Website

This is the source code for my GT (Georgia Tech) Block Showcase Project. I wrote this code in 2nd semester 9th grade and am writing this README one year later.

Website Finished: May 15, 2023

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript

This was my second time making a complete website from start to finish. One of the requirements was to have a form on the website without using an iframe of Google Forms to collect responses. This required a bit of problem-solving on my end, but I settled on implementing my own form in Javascript using localStorage and the power of math.

This project taught me how to use localStorage to hold longer-term data and implementing JSON in my code. Unlike my previous website, I determined a color palette and layout beforehand, rather than just starting to type up code. This project improved my  layout and design skills, as well as my project management skills.

Looking back at my code, I can see several issues and errors, which is evidence of improvement and growth in my coding skills from last year.
